# Matlab-Guitar-tuner
<p align="justify">Guitar tuner matlab project done in cooperation with a colleague. <br> 
This code is a simple design of a guitar tuner. It listens to the sounds collected from the microphone and indicates how to change the string tension so that a particular sound has the right tone. <br> <br>
Opeartions done in the code: <br>
1. Asking for selecting a string <br>
2. Listening to the sound collected from the default audio device <br>
3. Applying bandpass filter <br>
4. Using Fast Fourier transform to determine frequency of the pulled string <br>
5. Comparing measured frequency to the refrence and giving feedback. <br>

Note: This code uses Audio Toolbox and Signal Processing Toolbox

Obvious improvements to make: Rewriting code in English, shortening the code by writing audio processing function, adding automatic string detection.
